The grid: The grid will be played on a 6x6 square, with letters for columns and numbers for rows. 

Selecting a ship: The program begins with a menu displaying the three different ship types (Corvette, Frigate, and Ironclad) and their stats, asking the user to select their ship. Once the user's ship has been selected, the program will ask the user to select a ship for the computer.

Placing the ship: The user's ship will be placed at coordinates (A, 1) and the computer's ship will be placed at (F, 6)

Gameplay: On every turn, the user will have the option of moving their ship or attacking. The user can only attack if the target is in range.
